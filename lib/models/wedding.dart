          'There are many guides both in the Al-Quran and hadith that encourage every Muslim to'
          ' carry out a marriage ritual The problem is, many people are still hesitant to get married '
          'and many of them are married but fall apart in the middle of the road. Young people who have '
          'not yet dared to marry mostly argue about financial matters that are said to be insufficient. '
          'Has not Allah guaranteed that each of His servants who are married will multiply their sustenance.'
          ' While those who fail to navigate the household ark always blame fate. The question is, is it'
          ' appropriate to blame Allah while the marriage is not based on love for Allah',

      descrip: 'Among the reasons young people get married is not enough sustenance. Even though the Prophet SAW had '
          'motivated, "Seek by you that sustenance by getting married." (HR. Dailami). This hadith, for Shaykh Nawawi '
          'Banten in Tanqih al-Qaul al-Hatsits, means that marriage with good intentions can attract sustenance.In '
          'another hadith, as quoted by Shaykh Nawawi Banten, the Prophet SAW said, "Sustenance can increase because '
          'of marriage." Likewise, "Marry you, you will undoubtedly be visited by many treasures." (HR. Bazzar). '
          'Theologically, this direction of the Prophet SAW must be welcomed positively, because his words are '
          'revelations.By getting married, all complicated problems will receive the help of Allah SAW. The Prophet'
          ' SAW ensured, "Three people will definitely help Allah, namely those who are jihad in the way of Allah, '
          'mukatab slaves who want to redeem themselves, and people who marry for honor." (HR. Turmudzi). Help in this '
          'case can be in the form of sustenance.',

      title: 'Love before marriage',
      descrip: 'The sentence of love before marriage is very popular. When I was given the opportunity to convey '
          'materials about love to teenagers, the question "Is it okay to love before marriage?". Many indeed forbid'
          ' it, do not allow it on the grounds that it opens space for adultery. I dont blame the person who forbids it, '
          'no. Because it is clear that the concept of love and romance today is already tainted and has met with '
          'disruption. Love is practiced in the wrong way as well as a door to immorality for many people.Love is'
          ' described by holding hands, going out twos or dating, neglecting, spending money, wasting time, approaching'
          ' and even committing adultery and so on. The point is that love is more described as a word that has negative'
          ' words and an activity that violates Allahs law. Our present world depicts love with such a face. So, do not '
          'be surprised if someone says that love before marriage is haram.However, I have my own definition of love.'
          ' If it true love, it should take us together to heaven. If it throws both of us to hell its not love. So, '
          'for me, the sentence love before marriage is in my life dictionary. A New Paradigm of Love. The world of '
          'love that we see in the spirit of our society today, in my opinion, is the world of love taught by magazines,'
          ' television, films and dramas that direct our love to the worlds version of love. In fact, not infrequently,'
          ' from children to elderly people, â€œYou dont have a boyfriend? Wow, out of date. How do you want to be a '
          'match later?We also sample their love life.Likewise, if we look at how to dress. On this day, the fashion '
          'or the way of dressing that is displayed by our celebrities, has become a trend in society. If religious '
          'education is weak and there is no process of the relationship between humans and God that is strong, it is '
          'not impossible that a public figure can become a god. We take the current trends and ignore Allahs '
          'commandments',
